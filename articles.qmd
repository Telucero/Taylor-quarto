#### Version Control Best Practices
*Published: December 2025*

Effective use of version control is crucial for any software development project. Here are some best practices I follow:

**Key Practices:**

1. Write clear, descriptive commit messages
2. Commit frequently with small, logical changes
3. Use branches for features and experiments
4. Review code before merging
5. Keep your main branch clean and deployable

**Git Tips:**

```bash
# View your commit history
git log --oneline --graph

# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Stage and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
```
